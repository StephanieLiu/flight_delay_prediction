# Implementation detail: we add the -c because pip-tools AND pip 
#                        try to resolve dependencies again, even
#                        if pip-tools already has set the version
#                        constraints.
#                        This must be a bug from either pip or pip-tools.
# Implementation detail: all.requirements.txt must be generated before
#                        this file is picked up by pip-tools.
